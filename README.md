# Display the products by using the API
This was a task where the goal was to fetch the product data from the public API and to display it on the webpage.

API link: https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products.json?brand=maybelline

The API call wold be displayed with the JSON format. After the API call, the products would be displayed within a table that would contain the columns such as:

ID,
Name,
Price,
Image,
Color (display only hex values),
Rating (display only products higher than then rating of 3)
